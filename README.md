# Energy Token Marketplace

## Short Summary

Decentralized energy marketplace using Polkadot parachain for peer-to-peer trading of household-generated energy tokens.

## Full Description

This project aims to revolutionize the energy sector by creating a decentralized, peer-to-peer energy commodity market on the blockchain. It addresses several key problems in the current energy market:

* Lack of incentives for household energy generation

* Inefficient energy distribution

* Limited control over energy consumption and costs

The solution leverages Polkadot's parachain technology to create a custom blockchain for energy token management. Each household's smart meter calculates the energy generated by solar panels or other sources, which is then converted into energy tokens (1 kWh = 1 token).

A marketplace dApp allows users to buy, sell, and trade these tokens, providing a direct economic incentive for energy generation and efficient consumption. The Polkadot parachain enables secure, fast, and cost-effective transactions, while ensuring interoperability with other blockchain networks.

## Technical Description

The project is built using the following technologies:

* Substrate Framework: Used to create a custom blockchain tailored for energy token management.
  
* Polkadot Parachain: Enables interoperability and shared security with the Polkadot relay chain.
  
* Substrate Node Template: Provides the foundation for the custom blockchain node.
  
* Substrate Front-End Template: Used to mint, burn and transfer tokens.
  
* Angular: Used to build the marketplace dApp.


## Key features of Polkadot and its parachain technology that make this project uniquely possible:

* Customizable Runtime: Allows implementation of specific logic for token minting, burning, and transfers based on energy generation and consumption.
  
* Interoperability: Enables potential future integration with other energy-related or financial parachains in the Polkadot ecosystem.
  
* Shared Security: Leverages the security of the Polkadot relay chain, reducing the need for a large, independent validator set.
  
* Scalability: Can handle a high volume of transactions as the energy marketplace grows.
  
* Forkless Upgrades: Allows for seamless updates to the blockchain logic without disrupting the network.
  
## The parachain includes custom pallets for:

* Token Management: Handles minting, burning, and balance tracking of energy tokens.
  
* Marketplace: Manages buy and sell orders, matching, and settlement.
  
This unique combination of Polkadot's parachain technology and custom Substrate modules creates a secure, efficient, and scalable platform for peer-to-peer energy trading, fostering a more sustainable and decentralized energy ecosystem.
